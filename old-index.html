Since that time, Mr. Sacci continued to serve as a public relations consultant to several international cargo transportation companies, including Active Aero Group and its subsidiaries, Active On-Demand and USA Jet Airlines; as well as Panalpina, and Nippon Air Cargo.</p>
  <p>Prior to his employment with Emery, he was president of his  own public relations counseling firm in <strong>New    York City</strong> for 20 years.  For nine of those years, Emery was among his  major clients before being asked to join the company full time.  His other major clients included <em>ITT  Corporation</em>; <em>The Christophers</em>; and <em>Seabury  &amp; Smith insurance</em> marketers and brokers<em>; </em>among others.  He also  specialized in public relations programs for major sporting events, including several  <em>Summer Olympic Games</em>.</p>

  <p>He completed studies for a Master of Arts degree in  International Relations from McGill   University, Montreal, Quebec,  in 1963 and was graduated from Boston   University in 1961 with a  Bachelor of Science in Public Relations degree.</p>
